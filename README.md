## Architecture Overview

![Cloud State Architecture](Diagram/architecture.png)

This diagram illustrates the complete infrastructure architecture managed by this Terraform project, showing the relationship between different AWS services and components.

### Architecture Components

#### Terraform State Management (Left Side)
- **HashiCorp Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code tool for provisioning and managing AWS resources
- **AWS Cloud**: Amazon Web Services platform hosting the infrastructure
- **Remote State Storage**: S3 bucket containing the state of cloud infrastructure with state tracking

#### AWS Cloud Architecture - Virtual Private Cloud (Right Side)

##### Network Infrastructure
- **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)**: Isolated network environment with green dashed boundary
- **Internet Gateway**: Entry and exit point for internet traffic at the top of VPC
- **Route Tables**: Network routing configuration with IP ranges (172.16.0.0, 172.16.1.0, 172.16.2.0)

##### Multi-Availability Zone Deployment (High Availability)

**Availability Zone 1 (Left Half of VPC):**
- **Public Subnet**: Internet-facing resources with direct internet access
  - **VPC NAT Gateway**: Network Address Translation for outbound internet access
- **Private Subnet**: Internal resources with enhanced security
  - **Amazon EC2**: Application server instance
  - **MySQL DB Instance**: Relational database (Amazon RDS) connected to EC2

**Availability Zone 2 (Right Half of VPC):**
- **Public Subnet**: Internet-facing resources
  - **Bastion Host Security Group**: Secure jump server for administrative access
  - **VPC NAT Gateway**: Network Address Translation for outbound access
- **Private Subnet**: Internal resources
  - **Amazon EC2**: Application server instance
  - **Cache Node**: In-memory caching service (Amazon ElastiCache) connected to EC2

#### Connectivity and Data Flow
1. **Internet Access**: Internet Gateway → Public Subnets → VPC NAT Gateways → Private Subnets
2. **Application Processing**: EC2 instances in private subnets process application requests
3. **Backend Services**: EC2 instances connect to MySQL DB (AZ1) and Cache Node (AZ2)
4. **Administrative Access**: Bastion Host Security Group provides secure access to private subnets
5. **State Management**: Terraform manages all infrastructure state via S3 bucket

#### Security Architecture
- **Multi-AZ Deployment**: High availability across availability zones
- **Private Subnets**: Internal resources isolated from internet
- **NAT Gateways**: Secure outbound internet access for private resources
- **Bastion Host**: Secure administrative access to private network
- **Security Groups**: Network-level firewall rules and access controls

### Security Architecture
- **Multi-AZ Deployment**: High availability across availability zones
- **Encryption**: Data encryption at rest and in transit
- **Private Subnets**: Internal resources isolated from internet
- **Security Groups**: Granular network access controls
- **IAM Roles**: Least privilege access principles

terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "your-terraform-state-bucket"
    key    = "cloud-state/terraform.tfstate"
    region = "us-west-2"
  }
}
```
